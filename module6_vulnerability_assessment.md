## Vulnerability Asssessment

```
# Goal of a Vulenrability Assessment is not to exploit a machine, but rather to identity, categorize, and document the targets vulnerabilities.

# Steps

  1. identify all systems on the network, and categorize by assumed risk
  2. Scanning Policies
  3. Types of Scans
  4. Configure Scan (Hosts, Ports, protocols, noise level, time of scans, notifcations, dashboards)
  5. Perform Scan
  6. Determine risks of the scan (Shouldnt this come before running the scan lol)
  7. Decipher Scan Results
  8. Remediation Plan


# Key Terms

  1. Vulnerability: Weakness or bug on a system
  2. Threat: Process that amplifies the potential of an adverse event
  3. Vulnerability + Threat = Risk
  4. Exploit: Resource that can be used to take advantage of an asset


# Asset Management

  1. Inventory list of what you have, you cannot protect something you dont know you have
    - All data stored on premises (HHD, SSD, etc)
    - Remotely Stored Data (Cloud, off site servers, etc)
    - Remote SaaS applications
    - Applications
    - Local networking equipment
```

### Vulnerability Scanning

```
# Scanning Platforms

  1. Nessus
  2. Nexpose
  3. Qualys
  4. OpemVAS

# Nessu Output

  1. Use the nessus-report-downloader to pull remote reports
    a. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eelsivart/nessus-report-downloader/master/nessus6-report-downloader.rb

# Nessus Issues

  1. All ports open or closed: Ping remote host option
  2. Ensure "safe checks" option is enables to avoid adverse effects
  3. Use vnstat to monitor bandwidth before and during scan


# OpenVAS

  1. Reporting Tool: https://github.com/TheGroundZero/openvasreporting
  Command: python3 -m openvasreporting -i report-2bf466b5-627d-4659-bea6-1758b43235b1.xml -f xlsxi

# Final Report should contain the following

  1. Executive Summary
  2. Overview
  3. Scope
  4. Vulernabilites and Recommendations
```

## Additional Notes & Tips

- üí° Save Nessus scan results as `.nessus` files to diff with follow‚Äëup scans later.
- üìä Prioritize findings by combining CVSS with exploit maturity from Exploit‚ÄëDB.
- üõ†Ô∏è Automate daily vuln scans with cron plus OpenVAS for evolving targets.
